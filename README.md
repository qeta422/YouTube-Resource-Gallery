# YouTube-Resource-Gallery
A YouTube resource gallery where you can save all videos from YouTube that are helpful resources for you or just may want to save them for later that you can go back and visit anytime.
<br>
In this JavaScript program, we have videos with a zoom in effect. When you click on one, you get the video pop up so you can watch that right inside the app and click away anytime if you decide to stop watching.
<br>
We can also add additional ID-s that will find an image for a video and let us access/watch it from our app.
<br>
ID-s are stored in a local storage. (working on adding a database)
<br>
Lastly, the site is responsive so as we shrink down the window, elements on the page will move around and change their size so that they can look as good on many different screen sizes.
